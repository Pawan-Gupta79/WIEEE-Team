# 1. Introduction
Welcome to Formula WIEEE, where curiosity meets circuitry and creativity takes the
wheel. Co-hosted by Women in Engineering and IEEE Concordia, this beginner-friendly
robotics competition invites you to design, build, and race your own F1-inspired robotic
car.
You’ll tackle an obstacle course built to test your car’s speed, control, and adaptability,
all while learning the fundamentals of electronics, mechanics, and programming. So
grab your team, fire up your imagination, and get ready to race.
It’s lights out and away WIEEE go!


 # 2. Challenge description
Your team, consisting of 4 people, will have a 29 day design period to create the best
robotic solution using the provided materials. On competition day, teams will showcase
their creations through a series of challenges: a Sprint Race, Qualifying Lap, and Grand
Prix Race. The aim is to test each car’s speed, control, and adaptability on a
custom-built track revealed that morning.

2.1. Objectives
Teams must:
1. Design and build a robotic car using the provided components.
2. Optimize performance across three main challenges:
a. Sprint: Measure of acceleration and straight-line stability.
b. Qualifying: Timed solo lap to determine bracket seeding.
c. Grand Prix: Head-to-head race for the championship.
3. Demonstrate creativity, teamwork, and sound engineering principles.

2.2. Vehicle Constraints & Technical Specs
2.2.1. Materials

Each team will receive a standardized kit, which includes:
● ESP32
● 2x (DC motors + 2x wheels)
● Ball Wheel
● Motor driver
● Wires
● 4x AA batteries (building phase)
● 4x AA batteries (race day)
2.2.2 External Additions

Teams are permitted to use minor external components that assist with stability,
structure, or design, but do not provide a major competitive advantage.
Examples of allowed additions include:
● Neutral (free-rolling) wheels for added balance or smoother turning
● Mounting hardware such as screws, bolts, zip ties, or tape
● Foam, cardboard, or plastic supports to reinforce the chassis or protect wiring
● Decorative or aesthetic parts (stickers, body shells, flags, etc.) that don’t affect
performance
● Small bearings or bushings used passively to reduce friction
● Battery holders or clips for alternate mounting setups
● Wire extensions or jumper cables for improved layout flexibility
These modifications are allowed to encourage creativity and improve durability without
providing additional power or functionality.

2.2.3 Prohibited Additions
The following components are not allowed:
● External or additional power sources (e.g., LiPo batteries, USB banks, etc.)
● Additional motors, servos, or sensors beyond the provided kit
● Alternate microcontrollers or communication modules
● Modified or upgraded motor drivers
● Any component that provides a performance or control advantage beyond the
standard kit

2.2.4 Chassis Design

The chassis design is fully up to the team.
Participants may use any construction material, such as foam board, cardboard, or 3D-printed plastic, as long as the vehicle remains within the official size limit of 7
inches wide × 10 inches long.

2.2.5 Control System

All teams must use RemoteXY as their control interface.
No other control system, app, or protocol is permitted.

2.3. Course & Track Rules
The racecourse will remain a surprise until the day of the event to encourage adaptable
and creative design.
The course may include:
- Straight sections for speed tests.
- Turns and obstacles to test control and stability.
- Variable surfaces or inclines simulating real-world racing dynamics.
There shall be a separate 5-meter sprint lane for acceleration trials.

2.4. Sprint, Qualifying, Race

● Sprint Race
- Straight 5-meter track.
- Best out of 2 attempts.
- Ranking based on lowest recorded time.

● Qualifying
- Solo timed lap on the race track (revealed on the day).
- Ranking based on lowest recorded time.
- Timings will determine starting order on the grid.

● Grand Prix Race (Multi-heat elimination format)
- Race: 5 groups of 6 cars (fastest 10 cars advance).
- Semifinals: 2 groups of 5 cars (fastest 6 cars advance).
- Finale: 6-car championship race.
- Winners determined by finish order; contact allowed within fair limits.
- Judges may restart or disqualify in case of repeated collisions or unsafe driving.

2.5. Tools
The following will be available on Competition day to make adjustments:
- Screwdriver.
- Wire cutter.
- Hot glue gun (Tentative).
Teams must perform all assembly and programming themselves.
Supervisors may assist only with safety guidance, not direct construction or
coding.
